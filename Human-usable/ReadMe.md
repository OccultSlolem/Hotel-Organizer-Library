# Hotel Organizer!

Hello, valued human! Thank you for your interest in my program. Here you will find instructions on how to use this program. If you wish to know more,
there is a wiki on this software's GitHub page (https://github.com/Uberlyuber/Hotel-Organizer-Library/wiki). However, this will guide you on how to use this program.


# Setup

Setup is easy - simply create a folder to put everything in, open the .zip file, navigate to human-usable, and extract everything in that folder
to the folder you created earlier. Once you do that, depending on your operating system, there are different instructions:

## Linux

Press ctrl+alt+T to open a terminal. From there, type in the following instructions (Do not type in the $ symbol)

`$ cd Home/directory/otherDirectory/hotelOrganizer`

(Replace directory and otherDirectory with the path to the folder you extracted. You may have to replace hotelOrganizer with the name of the folder you made earlier)

From there, you can type in the following command:

`$ python console.py`

And you can run it from there! If you don't want to always pull up a console every time you want to run it, do the following:

1.) Right click in the directory where you extracted all the files into

2.) Drag your mouse to new file, and click empty document. Do NOT make a text document

3.) Name it anything you want, but make sure it ends with .sh

4.) Double click to open it

5.) Put the following code in:

`#!/bin/bash
python ~/home/Path to the directory you made/console.py`

After that, save the file and close it. Right click the file you made, and click properties. Go to permissions, and check "Allow opening this file as an executable program." (without the quotes)

Then simply right click and enjoy! Note that depending on your distribution of Linux, these instructions may be different.

## Windows

NOTE: Make sure you install Python before doing this, or it won't work (www.python.org)

Press the windows key and, in search, type in "cmd" (without quotes). From there, type in the following command:

`C:/Python27/python.exe C:/Users/Your username/path to the folder you made/console.py`
